## Getting started?

Keeping a set of publically accessible, spell & sanity checked docs is hard, so please bear with us. We're using [github.io pages](https://pages.github.com) with the custom domain [docs.listingslab.com](https://docs.listingslab.com) and a custom theme. So when we say _Getting Started_, we mean us, not you. This [repository](https://github.com/listingslab-software/docs) is of course [Open Source](docs/tech/open-source) on GitHub, and PRs are welcome.
