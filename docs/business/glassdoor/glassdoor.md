Score 1/5

- Former Employee - UI/User Experience Designer in Brisbane
- Doesn't Recommend
- Negative Outlook

> I worked at Rex Software full-time for less than a year

### Pros

Had the opportunity to meet and work with some talented people.

### Cons

Easily the worst place I have ever worked in my entire career. Micromanagement, constant all-staff job threats, poor leadership, no direction and to top it off an abusive CEO shouting at the employees for his own faults. Despite the money they'll throw at you, working for people like them is genuinely not worth it. Save your mental health and time.

### Advice to Management

Advice to employees who read these reviews - stand up for yourselves and fellow employees.

### Score 5/5

- Former Employee - Product Engineer in Teneriffe
- Recommends
- Positive Outlook

>  I worked at Rex Software full-time for more than 3 years

### Pros

Main pros, from experience: 1. You get paid well 2. You will probably have a lot of fun 3. You get a tonne of deep experience During the 3+ years I worked at Rex, I was presented with dozens of career opportunities in the way of: • Being mentored directly by the leadership • Creating & managing new products • Working on the business (culture) • Engaging with community • Flying abroad to learn • Making good friends • ...oof, so much more This spread of opportunity is more or less the same for all employees at Rex, which I think is great for folks that want to progress among like-minded people. Besides the important professional pro's, there are also more enticing pro's: • Spending of the learning budget is flexible • You can change up your hours and/or work remotely when you need to • There is free food and drink everyday, which saves you buckets of cash longterm • Community involvement exists, which indicates leadership give a toot • The office space is mint • If you need some new hardware etc, you'll get it • Free gym & yoga (take advantage of it, sitting at desks is unhealthy) • ... missing quite a few, go read some other reviews (except some of the neg ones that look like they're written by the same person)

### Cons

Main cons, from experience: 1. You don't get overtime or equivalent (hope this changes) 2. You will burn out easily if you don't self-manage well 3. You will feel bad for skipping the free gym sessions lol 4. The lines between roles blur when you don't want them to "Millennial Burnout" is real and thrives in environments like Tech Startups. But saying that... leadership at Rex seem to be making considerable efforts to rein that in by presenting Rex staff with clearer role descriptions, better-defined work, and professional mental health appointments.

### Advice to Management

Keep up each of your personal efforts in remaining sane.
