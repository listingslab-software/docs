## Rex Software Glassdoor Review

This is listinglab's review of working for Rex.

### Overview

I worked at Rex for 3 months. I wish I hadn't. It was obvious from day 1 that it was a bad fit and had I had the choice I would have walked at the end of the first week. I did not. I stayed for 3 months and this is what I think of the company. IMHO.

Rex as a company seems properous and with good reason. The company sells a Real Estate CRM solution and the sales dept is second to none, run by founder Lana. 

The design/marketing team support sales well and with equally strong customer support and very low overhead you've got great business.

Unfortunately I didn't work in any of those areas because I'm a software developer. The software development department **is** Rex's overhead and working there feels like that.

The company founding story says it all. Lana, successful in Real Estate herself knew that it was because she had a superior system. She convinced Alex, her son, to turn that system into software which is now called the 'rex core product'. Then she built a company around it.

A decade down the road, Alex is now CTO of a thriving company and out of his depth.
