Chamonix Mont Blanc, France. The death sport and freeskiing capital of the world. This is the closing day party on the Grande Montets, 4th May 2008.

There's parapenting, hot women and even some nutters jumping out of a heliwopper with squirrel suits on.

Best of all, it was one of the first films that we made in High Definition.
