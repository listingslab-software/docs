## Film

Film, Video, Movies, Film Clips, call 'em what you like, we've been making them for years. In fact we started making films when it was only just possible to buy a cheap digital camcorder and record your stuff onto a desktop computer hard drive to edit with a cracked copy of Adobe Premiere. I wasn't very interested in old school celluloid film back then & I'm still not.
