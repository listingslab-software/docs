The GoPro has made timelapsing part of it's core funtionality. You set the camera on a tripod, hit record and it will sort everything out for you into a tidy little timelapsed clip.

This is good because if you want to compress an hour of footage into 10 seconds, that initial hour of footage is going to have a massive filesize and make forblems for numpty editors.
