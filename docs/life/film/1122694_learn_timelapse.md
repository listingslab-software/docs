With the weather being dreadful these past few weeks I've been experimenting with my new video camera (Sony HDR-HC1E).

This short experiment is the beginnings of learning how to make a time lapse film. The basic process is this:

1. Using the camera's interval still shot feature, I set the camera up to take an hour or so of still pictures at a delay of 1 minute.

2. I imported those stills onto my computer and retouched them all as a batch using photoShop

3. Using quicktime Pro, I converted the frame sequences into quicktime movie

4. Then stuck 'em all together in iMovie.

I can't wait till the weather clears up a bit and I can use this technique to do something really good.
