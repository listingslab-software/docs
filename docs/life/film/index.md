## Films

[Life](../) | [Home](../..)

Films, Videos, Movies, Film Clips, call 'em what you like, we've been making 'em for [donkey's years](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/donkey%27s_years). In fact we started making films when it was only just possible to buy a cheap digital camcorder and record your stuff onto a desktop computer hard drive to edit with a cracked copy of Adobe Premiere. I wasn't very interested in old school celluloid film back then & I'm still not.
