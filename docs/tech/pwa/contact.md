## Contact

Contact forms have been a stable feature of practically every website since the beginning and that is unlikely to change any time soon. It's generally the main goal of a public facing web-presence; to initiate contact with an audience.

### What does a contact form look like in 2019?

A normal contact form in 2019 would have a required email field, a message box and a submit button. The form will generally be validated and upon submission will provide the user with feedback letting them know that their message has been sent. Then they wait. Sometimes for ever.

### How does listingslab PWA improve this?

Email address is not a required field. That is because messages are managed on the cloud, bot via email. Messages are written and received on the app with email as a backup.
