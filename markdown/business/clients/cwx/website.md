## Website

Whitelabel PWA Demo

## Requirements

> The goal is to make the website less generic, and more appealing to a prospective new employee.

- Remove any mention of Wordpress and other activities that we don't do.
- Remove stock images of guys in suits etc.
- Remove the contact email address and replace with a contact form from something like https://kwes.io.
- First step is to hunt around for some good examples from similar dev companies to serve as inspiration.
